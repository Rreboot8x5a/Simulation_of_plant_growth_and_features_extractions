# Hi, I am a repository based on CPlantBox

## My purpose :
1. Simulate different plants through time 
2. Simulate the view of a nadir RGB-d camera (like Kinect or Intel Realsense)
3. Extract the features of the plant through time with the camera data

## Installation guide

You just have to follow the guide of [CPlantBox](https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox) installation.
When done, add the unique folder of this repo to the root folder of your CPlantBox project.
Finally, enjoy the code (if you understand it btw)
